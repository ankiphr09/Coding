# Rearrange array such that arr[i] >= arr[j] 
# if i is even and arr[i]<=arr[j] if i is odd and j < i
# Examples:

# Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
# Output : 4 5 3 6 2 7 1

# Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8} 
# Output : 4 5 2 6 1 8 1 8

# The idea to solve this problem is to first create an auxiliary copy of the original array 
# and sort the copied array. 
# Now total number of even position in array with n elements will be floor(n/2) and 
# remaining is the number of odd positions. Now fill the odd and even positions in 
# the original array using the sorted array in the below manner:

# Total odd positions will be n â€“ floor(n/2). Start from (n-floor(n/2))th position in 
# the sorted array and copy the element to 1st position of sorted array. 
# Start traversing the sorted array from this position towards left and 
# keep filling the odd positions in the original array towrds right.
# Start traversing the sorted array starting from (n-floor(n/2)+1)th position towards right 
# and keep filling the original array starting from 2nd position.

# Python3 code to rearrange the array 
# as per the given condition 
import array as a 
import numpy as np 

# function to rearrange the array 
def rearrangeArr(arr, n): 
	
	# total even positions 
	evenPos = int(n / 2) 

	# total odd positions 
	oddPos = n - evenPos 

	# intialising empty array in python 
	tempArr = np.empty(n, dtype = object) 

	# copy original array in an 
	# auxiliary array 
	for i in range(0, n): 
		
		tempArr[i] = arr[i] 

	# sort the auxiliary array 
	tempArr.sort() 
    # for i in range(n):
    #     print (tempArr[i], end = ' ')
	j = oddPos - 1

	# fill up odd position in original 
	# array 
	for i in range(0, n, 2): 

		arr[i] = tempArr[j] 
		j = j - 1
	
	j = oddPos 

	# fill up even positions in original 
	# array 
	for i in range(1, n, 2): 
		arr[i] = tempArr[j] 
		j = j + 1
	
	# display array 
	for i in range(0, n): 
		print (arr[i], end = ' ') 

# Driver code 
arr = a.array('i', [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]) 
rearrangeArr(arr, 7)
