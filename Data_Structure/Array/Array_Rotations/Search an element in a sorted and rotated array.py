# All solutions provided here assume that all elements in array are distinct.

# The idea is to find the pivot point, divide the array in two sub-arrays and call binary search.
# The main idea for finding pivot is – for a sorted (in increasing order) and pivoted array, pivot element is the only element for which next element to it is smaller than it.
# Using above criteria and binary search methodology we can get pivot element in O(logn) time

# Input arr[] = {3, 4, 5, 1, 2}
# Element to Search = 1
#   1) Find out pivot point and divide the array in two
#       sub-arrays. (pivot = 2) /*Index of 5*/
#   2) Now call binary search for one of the two sub-arrays.
#       (a) If element is greater than 0th element then
#              search in left array
#       (b) Else Search in right array
#           (1 will go in else as 1 < 0th element(3))
#   3) If element is found in selected sub-array then return index
#      Else return -1.


# Python Program to search an element

# 	# If we didn't find a pivot, 
# 	# then array is not rotated at all 
# 	if pivot == -1:

# 	# compare with pivot and then

# 		return pivot 
# 	if arr[0] <= key: 
# 		return binarySearch(arr, 0, pivot-1, key) 
# 	return binarySearch(arr, pivot+1, n-1, key)

# Improved Solution:
# We can search an element in one pass of Binary Search. The idea is to search

# 1) Find middle point mid = (l + h)/2
# 2) If key is present at middle point, return mid.
# 3) Else If arr[l..mid] is sorted
#     a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[l]
#        to arr[mid], recur for arr[l..mid].
#     b) Else recur for arr[mid+1..h]
# 4) Else (arr[mid+1..h] must be sorted)
#     a) If key to be searched lies in range from arr[mid+1]
#        to arr[h], recur for arr[mid+1..h].
#     b) Else recur for arr[l..mid] 

# Search an element in sorted and rotated array using 
# single pass of Binary Search 

# Returns index of key in arr[l..h] if key is present, 
# otherwise returns -1 
def search (arr, l, h, key): 
	if l > h: 
		return -1
	
	mid = (l + h) // 2
	if arr[mid] == key: 
		return mid 

	# If arr[l...mid] is sorted 
	if arr[l] <= arr[mid]: 

		# As this subarray is sorted, we can quickly 
		# check if key lies in half or other half 
		if key >= arr[l] and key <= arr[mid]: 
			return search(arr, l, mid-1, key) 
		return search(arr, mid+1, h, key) 

	# If arr[l..mid] is not sorted, then arr[mid... r] 
	# must be sorted 
	if key >= arr[mid] and key <= arr[h]: 
		return search(arr, mid+1, h, key) 
	return search(arr, l, mid-1, key) 

# Driver program 
arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3] 
key = 10
i = search(arr, 0, len(arr)-1, key) 
if i != -1: 
	print ("Index: %d"%i) 
else: 
	print ("Key not found") 

# How to handle duplicates?
# It doesn’t look possible to search in O(Logn) time in all cases when duplicates are allowed. 
# For example consider searching 0 in {2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2} 
# and {2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}. It doesn’t look possible to decide whether to 
# recur for left half or right half by doing constant number of comparisons at the middle.
